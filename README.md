GLaDOS Voice Running in Wyoming Piper

Inspiration taken from [Adam Conway](https://www.xda-developers.com/glados-controls-smart-home-home-assistant/). Image based on [rhasspp/wyoming-piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-piper), packaged with voice from [GLaDOS Personality Core](https://github.com/dnhkng/GLaDOS).

## Versioning

The major, minor, and patch versions of this image will be identical to the underlying rhasspp/wyoming-piper version. An ever increasing run number will be appended to differentiate new builds on the same version of Piper.
